## EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is an important step in any Data Analysis or Data Science project. EDA is the process of investingating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset.

EDA involves generating summary statistics for numerical data in the dataset and creating various graphical representations to understand the data better.
